# Roll20_FFG_StarWars_CharacterSheet
Creating a new Roll20 character sheet for FFG Star Wars; compatible with FFG-SWRPG-Dice-Roller

#Version 1.0

This sheet is inspired by and an alternative to the Star Wars FFG API-Compatible sheet.  When our small tabletop FFG Star Wars gaming group went online during the COVID-19 situation, we began using that sheet.  As the GM, I saw an opportunity to taylor the sheet to my group's needs.  As a web app designer by trade, I found it to be a compelling project during my downtime at home.  Rather than branching that project, I started fresh and utilized the latest (as of May 2020) CSS Grid techniques for the interface and Roll20 Sheet Workers to power most of the calcs.

There are many things that other sheet does which I have not recreated, most notably GM info, Vehicles, and Companions.  This sheet is focused entirely on a single PC.  That said, I think I've added a few new features I did not see in the other sheet.  Our group has only playtested this a handful of times so far, but it seems relatively stable.  There are bugs, I'm sure.

Along with the new sheet, some in the group also worked a custom branch of the FFG-SWRPG-Dice-Roller to integrate with the new sheet.  Since it has references to this sheet in particular, we haven't tried a PR to the main branch of the dice roller, but have kept our own version.  Perhaps we will roll that up, too, someday.
